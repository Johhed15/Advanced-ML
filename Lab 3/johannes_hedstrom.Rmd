Q-Learning. The file RL Lab1.R in the course website contains a template of the Q-
learning algorithm. You are asked to complete the implementation. We will work with a grid-
world environment consisting of H x W tiles laid out in a 2-dimensional grid. An agent acts
by moving up, down, left or right in the grid-world. This corresponds to the following Markov
decision process:

* State space: $S = {(x, y)∣x \in {1, . . . , H}, y \in {1, . . . , W }}$.

* Action space: $A = {up, down, lef t, right}$.

Additionally, we assume state space to be fully observable. The reward function is a deterministic function of the state and does not depend on the actions taken by the agent. We assume
the agent gets the reward as soon as it moves to a state. The transition model is defined by
the agent moving in the direction chosen with probability $(1-\beta)$. The agent might also slip and
end up moving in the direction to the left or right of its chosen action, each with probability $\beta/2$.
The transition model is unknown to the agent, forcing us to resort to model-free solutions. The
environment is episodic and all states with a non-zero reward are terminal. Throughout this
lab we use integer representations of the different actions: Up=1, right=2, down=3 and left=4.

For our first environment, we will use H = 5 and W = 7. This environ-
ment includes a reward of 10 in state (3,6) and a reward of -1 in states (2,3), (3,3) and (4,3).
We specify the rewards using a reward map in the form of a matrix with one entry for each
state. States with no reward will simply have a matrix entry of 0. The agent starts each episode
in the state (3,1). The function vis environment in the file RL Lab1.R is used to visualize
the environment and learned action values and policy. You will not have to modify this function,
but read the comments in it to familiarize with how it can be used.
When implementing Q-learning, the estimated values of Q(S, A) are commonly stored in
a data-structured called Q-table. This is nothing but a tensor with one entry for each state-
action pair. Since we have a H × W environment with four actions, we can use a 3D-tensor
of dimensions H x W x 4 to represent our Q-table. Initialize all Q-values to 0. Run the function vis environment before proceeding further. Note that each non-terminal tile has four
values. These represent the action values associated to the tile (state). Note also that each
non-terminal tile has an arrow. This indicates the greedy policy for the tile (ties are broken at
random).


our are requested to carry out the following tasks.

* Implement the greedy and $\epsilon$ -greedy policies in the functions GreedyPolicy and EpsilonGreedyPolicy of the file RL Lab1.R. The functions should break ties at random, i.e. they should sample uniformly from the set of actions with maximal Q-value.

* Implement the Q-learning algorithm in the function q learning of the file RL Lab1.R. The function should run one episode of the agent acting in the environment and update the Q-table accordingly. The function should return the episode reward and the sum of the temporal-difference correction terms R + γ maxa Q(S ′ , a) − Q(S, A) for all steps in the episode. Note that a transition model taking β as input is already implemented for you in the function transition model.

* Run 10000 episodes of Q-learning with $\epsilon$ = 0.5, $\beta$ = 0, $\alpha$ = 0.1 and $\gamma$ = 0.95. To do so, simply run the code provided in the file RL Lab1.R. The code visualizes the Q-table and a greedy policy derived from it after episodes 10, 100, 1000 and 10000. Answer the following questions:


```{r}
# Environment A (learning)
set.seed(12345)
H <- 5
W <- 7

reward_map <- matrix(0, nrow = H, ncol = W)
reward_map[3,6] <- 10
reward_map[2:4,3] <- -1

q_table <- array(0,dim = c(H,W,4))

vis_environment()

for(i in 1:10000){
  foo <- q_learning(start_state = c(3,1))
  
  if(any(i==c(10,100,1000,10000)))
    vis_environment(i)
}

```
    – What has the agent learned after the first 10 episodes ?
    
After the first 10 episodes the agent havent learned that much, but it has updated the three boxes left of (-1) to not move to the right. 

    – Is the final greedy policy (after 10000 episodes) optimal for all states, i.e. not only for the initial state ? Why / Why not ? 

The final greedy policy isnt optimal for all states, for example the box below the obsticle(-1) is moving to up and not to the and sometimes it wants us to move out of the world/map. Or it could be something with the plot, as the values seem to be correct but not the arrows. 


    – Do the learned values in the Q-table reflect the fact that there are multiple paths (above and below the negative rewards) to get to the positive reward ? If not, what could be done to make it happen ?

The values are higher to go above the negative rewards, what could be done is to explore more when choosing the next action. 


# 3 

Environment B. This is a 7x8 environment where the top and bottom rows have negative
rewards. In this environment, the agent starts each episode in the state (4, 1). There are two
positive rewards, of 5 and 10. The reward of 5 is easily reachable, but the agent has to navigate
around the first reward in order to find the reward worth 10.
Your task is to investigate how the $\epsilon$  and γ parameters affect the learned policy by running
30000 episodes of Q-learning with $\epsilon$  = 0.1, 0.5, $\gamma$  = 0.5, 0.75, 0.95,  $\beta$  = 0 and $\alpha$ = 0.1. To do so,
simply run the code provided in the file RL Lab1.R and explain your observations.


```{r}
# Environment B (the effect of epsilon and gamma)

H <- 7
W <- 8

reward_map <- matrix(0, nrow = H, ncol = W)
reward_map[1,] <- -1
reward_map[7,] <- -1
reward_map[4,5] <- 5
reward_map[4,8] <- 10

q_table <- array(0,dim = c(H,W,4))

vis_environment()

MovingAverage <- function(x, n){
  
  cx <- c(0,cumsum(x))
  rsum <- (cx[(n+1):length(cx)] - cx[1:(length(cx) - n)]) / n
  
  return (rsum)
}

for(j in c(0.5,0.75,0.95)){
  q_table <- array(0,dim = c(H,W,4))
  reward <- NULL
  correction <- NULL
  
  for(i in 1:30000){
    foo <- q_learning(gamma = j, start_state = c(4,1))
    reward <- c(reward,foo[1])
    correction <- c(correction,foo[2])
  }
  
  vis_environment(i, gamma = j)
  plot(MovingAverage(reward,100),type = "l")
  plot(MovingAverage(correction,100),type = "l")
}

for(j in c(0.5,0.75,0.95)){
  q_table <- array(0,dim = c(H,W,4))
  reward <- NULL
  correction <- NULL
  
  for(i in 1:30000){
    foo <- q_learning(epsilon = 0.1, gamma = j, start_state = c(4,1))
    reward <- c(reward,foo[1])
    correction <- c(correction,foo[2])
  }
  
  vis_environment(i, epsilon = 0.1, gamma = j)
  plot(MovingAverage(reward,100),type = "l")
  plot(MovingAverage(correction,100),type = "l")
}
```

## Epsilon= 0.5, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.5, beta=0

High values for the moving average reward, correction gets close to zero around 5k episodes. Q table only gives reward close to 5 or 10.


## Epsilon= 0.5, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.75, beta=0

The results looks to be close as for gamma = 0.5, the difference is that the moving average reward grows more linear and earlier.  

## Epsilon= 0.5, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.95, beta=0

It takes much longer to get high average reward as to the previous two. We can see that in the Q-table we have much higher values on more places as they are taking in future rewards more with a high gamma. The first episodes correct much more and for the previous two. 

## Epsilon= 0.1, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.5, beta=0

If we compare this to the one with epsilon = 0.5 and gamma = 0.5 we see that we don't learn that much and that we are not improving when looking at the moving average reward. 

## Epsilon= 0.1, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.75, beta=0

We havent explored that much but we move to 10 easier than with gamma =0.5.

## Epsilon= 0.1, alpha=0.1, gamma=0.95, beta=0

Even though epsilon = 0.1(low exploration), we have high values for most of the states, which is because we consider long term reward highly. 
The same results as before with gamma = 0.95, we correct much more in the first episodes.



# 4

Environment C. This is a smaller 3 x 6 environment. Here the agent starts each episode
in the state (1,1). Your task is to investigate how the $\beta$ parameter affects the learned policy by
running 10000 episodes of Q-learning with  $\beta$  = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.66, $\epsilon$ = 0.5, $\gamma$ = 0.6 and $\alpha$ = 0.1. To
do so, simply run the code provided in the file RL Lab1.R and explain your observations.

```{r}

# Environment C (the effect of beta).

H <- 3
W <- 6

reward_map <- matrix(0, nrow = H, ncol = W)
reward_map[1,2:5] <- -1
reward_map[1,6] <- 10

q_table <- array(0,dim = c(H,W,4))

vis_environment()

for(j in c(0,0.2,0.4,0.66)){
  q_table <- array(0,dim = c(H,W,4))
  
  for(i in 1:10000)
    foo <- q_learning(gamma = 0.6, beta = j, start_state = c(1,1))
  
  vis_environment(i, gamma = 0.6, beta = j)
}
```

With higher probability(higher beta) to slip to left or right when starting in position (1,1) the agent have a problem to explore and learn the optimal path to the wanted state.

[Link to José's jupyter NB](https://github.com/STIMALiU/AdvMLCourse/blob/master/ReinforcementLearning/RL_Lab2_Colab.ipynb)


The file RL Lab2 Colab.ipynb in the course website contains an implementation of the REINFORCE algorithm. The file also contains the result of running the code,
so that you do not have to run it. So, you do not need to run it if you do not want.1 Your task is
to study the code and the results obtained, and answer some questions.
We will work with a 4 x 4 grid. We want the agent to learn to navigate to a random goal
position in the grid. The agent will start in a random position and it will be told the goal position.
The agent receives a reward of 5 when it reaches the goal. Since the goal position can be
any position, we need a way to tell the agent where the goal is. Since our agent does not
have any memory mechanism, we provide the goal coordinates as part of the state at every
time step, i.e. a state consists now of four coordinates: Two for the position of the agent, and
two for the goal position. The actions of the agent can however only impact its own position,
i.e. the actions do not modify the goal position. Note that the agent initially does not know
that the last two coordinates of a state indicate the position with maximal reward, i.e. the goal
position. It has to learn it. It also has to learn a policy to reach the goal position from the
initial position. Moreover, the policy has to depend on the goal position, because it is chosen
at random in each episode. Since we only have a single non-zero reward, we do not specify
a reward map. Instead, the goal coordinates are passed to the functions that need to access
the reward function.


# 6


Environment D. In this task, we will use eight goal positions for training and, then, validate the learned policy on the remaining eight possible goal positions. The training and validation goal positions are stored in the lists train goals and val goals in the code in the
file RL Lab2 Colab.ipynb. The results provided in the file correspond to running the REINFORCE algorithm for 5000 episodes with $\beta$ = 0 and $\gamma$ = 0.95. Each training episode uses a
random goal position from train goals. The initial position for the episode is also chosen
at random. When training is completed, the code validates the learned policy for the goal positions in val goals. This is done by with the help of the function vis prob, which shows
the grid, goal position and learned policy. Note that each non-terminal tile has four values.
These represent the action probabilities associated to the tile (state). Note also that each non-
terminal tile has an arrow. This indicates the action with the largest probability for the tile (ties
are broken at random). Finally, answer the following questions:

\newpage
* Has the agent learned a good policy? Why / Why not ?


```{r ,fig.cap='Example before training'}
knitr::include_graphics('pic1.png')
```



```{r, fig.cap='Example after training'}
knitr::include_graphics('pic2.png')
```


The policy looks okay/decent, most of the time it finds the goal, but not every time so its not optimal. 



* Could you have used the Q-learning algorithm to solve this task ?





Q-learning would have problems as its saving action values in the Q-table, and this would take time to converge or create storage space problems. Unless you represent it as a parameterized function and does deep Q-learning, which advantages such as fewer parameters which removes the storage problem and generalization to unvisited states! So when using it in that way Q-learning could work. 




\newpage
# 7 


Environment E. In this task, the goals for training are all from the top row of the grid.
The validation goals are three positions from the rows below. To solve this task, simply study
the code and results provided in the file RL Lab2 Colab.ipynb and answer the following
questions:

* Has the agent learned a good policy? Why / Why not ?

The agent has not learned a good policy as its only trained to go to the row 4, all the policies whant the agent to move up. 

* If the results obtained for environments D and E differ, explain why

The agents differ as the first one has trained on each row and each column 2 times each so it has learnt to explore much of the world. But the second one has only learnt from goals in one row making it having problems to find goals on other rows, unless the starting position is below the goal.
